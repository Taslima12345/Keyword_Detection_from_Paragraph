A book fair is a special type of fair where book are the main attraction for all class of people. And the main thing about a book fair is not sale but display of book on different subjects by different writers. Now- a- days a book fair has become very popular. It has created a sense of interest for book amongst the general mass. Normally it is held in a field or premises. Recently I got an opportunity to visit a book fair. It was originated by Bangla Academy. Hundreds of pavilions were set up. There were a huge number of book on miscellaneous subject of different age. All sorts of book- fictions, text book, dramas, children book, reference book, novels etc were displayed. I purchased some book of my own choice. Some stalls were also found to sell snacks and cigarettes and thus to pollute the premises. I took some refreshment here. A book fair becomes crowdie especially in the evening. Both male and female customers gather at a book fair. The writers also visit the fair regularly. Seminars and cultural programmers are also held. A book fair reminds us that book are our best companions. They are always our sides when we are in danger. The change our outlook on life and widens our domain of knowledge. It is book which help us to forget jealousy, malice and superstition. Again we get these best friends at a cheaper rate from a book fair. Many novice writers can start their career from a book fair. It was a pleasant experience for me and I think a book fair is very important for the enlighten section of people. So, it should be organized more and more for the betterment of our future life.
