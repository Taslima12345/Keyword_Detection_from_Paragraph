The largest book fair is organized by ‘Bangla Academy’ on the occasion of the 21 February to commemorate the heroic sacrifice of our valiant martyrs. The main purpose of a book fair is not merely sale rather to offer a rare opportunity to assess the advancement made in the publication of books and to analyse recent views compared with previous book fairs . It helps to create new writers as well as new readers. It inspires people to instigate the habit of reading books. A book fair reminds us that books are our best companions. They change our outlook on life and widen our horizon of knowledge. Again we get these best friends at a cheaper rate from a book fair. In order to organize the fair a committee is formed. The committee makes all the arrangements to makes all the arrangements to make the fair successful. There should have arrangements of refreshments. Seminars and cultural programmes should be arranged. Moreover, strict security measures should be taken.
